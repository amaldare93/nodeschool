/*
HTTP FILE SERVER
Exercise 11 of 13

Write an HTTP server that serves the same text file for each request it receives.

Your server should listen on the port provided by the first argument to your program.

You will be provided with the location of the file to serve as the second command-line argument. You must use the fs.createReadStream() method to stream the file contents to the response.

var http = require('http'),
var fs = require('fs');
var port = process.argv[2];
var file = process.argv[3];

// start server
var server = http.createServer(function onCreateServer(req, res){
  // pipe file stream to response
  fs.createReadStream(file).pipe(res);

  // serve response?

});

server.listen(port);
